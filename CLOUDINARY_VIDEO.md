> - Many of Cloudinary's APIs default to `image` as the resource type. When running these APIs for videos, remember to explicitly set the `resource_type` to `video`.

> - When using [automatic format selection](video_optimization#automatic_format_selection) for videos, we recommend using `f_auto:video` to ensure a video is always delivered, even when no file extension is supplied.

> - The [Video player studio](https://console.cloudinary.com/app/video/player-studio) allows you to easily create, share or embed a video player with a video of your choice. You can open the studio for a specific asset directly from the asset's context menu (right clicking the asset) in the Media Library.
