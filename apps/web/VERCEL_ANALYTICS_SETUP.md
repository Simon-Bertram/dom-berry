# Vercel Analytics Setup

## Overview

Vercel Analytics has been successfully installed and configured in your Next.js 16 project using Bun as the package manager.

## Installation

- **Package Manager**: Bun (compatible with npm packages)
- **Package**: `@vercel/analytics@1.5.0`
- **Installation Command**: `bun add @vercel/analytics`

## Configuration

The Analytics component has been added to your root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):

```typescript
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";

// In the JSX:
<Analytics />;
```

## Features Enabled

- **Automatic Page Views**: Tracks page visits automatically
- **Web Vitals**: Monitors Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **Real User Monitoring**: Collects real user performance data
- **Privacy-Focused**: GDPR compliant, no cookies required

## How It Works

1. The `<Analytics />` component is placed at the bottom of your root layout
2. It automatically tracks page views and performance metrics
3. Data is sent to Vercel's analytics service
4. You can view analytics in your Vercel dashboard

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required for basic Vercel Analytics functionality. The analytics will work automatically when deployed to Vercel.

## Verification

To verify the setup is working:

1. Deploy your application to Vercel
2. Visit your deployed site
3. Check the Vercel dashboard for analytics data (may take a few minutes to appear)

## Compatibility

## Notes

- Analytics only work on Vercel deployments (not in local development)
- No configuration needed for basic functionality
