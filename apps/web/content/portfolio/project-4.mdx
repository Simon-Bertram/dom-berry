# Bath Music Festival Highlights

This project involved capturing the vibrant atmosphere and diverse performances at the Bath Music Festival, a three-day event featuring local and international artists across multiple venues throughout the historic city.

## Project Overview

The festival took place across five different venues in Bath:

- **Roman Baths** - Classical and acoustic performances
- **Assembly Rooms** - Jazz and contemporary music
- **Pulteney Bridge** - Street performances and buskers
- **Victoria Park** - Main stage with headline acts
- **Guildhall** - Intimate chamber music concerts

## Key Features

- **Multi-venue coverage** - Seamless transitions between different performance spaces
- **Live performance capture** - High-quality audio and video recording
- **Crowd atmosphere** - Capturing the festival's energy and community spirit
- **Artist interviews** - Behind-the-scenes conversations with performers
- **Time-lapse montages** - Showing the festival's transformation throughout the day

## Challenges

- **Multiple locations** - Coordinating equipment and crew across five venues
- **Audio mixing** - Capturing clean audio in various acoustic environments
- **Crowd management** - Filming without disrupting performances or audience experience
- **Lighting variations** - Adapting to different lighting conditions across venues
- **Tight schedule** - Covering multiple performances simultaneously

## Solution

We deployed a multi-camera setup with dedicated audio recording, used wireless systems for flexibility, and had a mobile editing station for quick turnaround of daily highlights.

## Deliverables

- **Festival highlights reel** (6 minutes)
- **Daily recap videos** (2 minutes each)
- **Artist spotlight videos** (1-2 minutes each)
- **Social media content** (15-30 second clips)
- **Full performance recordings** (for archive)
