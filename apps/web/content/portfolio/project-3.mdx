# Cornwall Coastal Documentary

This project involved creating a comprehensive documentary for the National Trust Cornwall, highlighting the stunning coastal landscapes and diverse wildlife found across their properties. The film was designed to promote conservation efforts and attract visitors to these protected areas.

## Project Overview

The documentary covers three key National Trust properties along the Cornwall coast:

- **St. Michael's Mount** - The iconic tidal island
- **Godrevy Point** - Famous lighthouse and seal colony
- **Kynance Cove** - Dramatic cliffs and turquoise waters

## Key Features

- **Aerial cinematography** - Drone footage showcasing the dramatic coastline
- **Wildlife filming** - Close-up shots of seals, seabirds, and marine life
- **Time-lapse sequences** - Capturing the changing tides and weather
- **Interview segments** - Local experts discussing conservation efforts
- **Cinematic grading** - Film-like color treatment for dramatic impact

## Challenges

- **Weather dependency** - Cornwall's unpredictable weather required flexible scheduling
- **Wildlife timing** - Coordinating with seasonal wildlife patterns
- **Access restrictions** - Working within National Trust guidelines and protected areas
- **Equipment protection** - Salt spray and sand damage prevention

## Solution

We used a multi-day approach with backup plans for weather, specialized equipment for marine environments, and extensive pre-production planning to maximize our time on location.

## Deliverables

- **Full documentary** (12 minutes)
- **Short promotional version** (3 minutes)
- **Social media clips** (30-60 seconds each)
- **Behind-the-scenes footage**
- **4K master files** for future use
